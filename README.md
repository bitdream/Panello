# Panello

Panello is a Tetris Attack/Panel de Pon clone for iOS using Swift 3.

### Information
Panel de Pon/Tetris Attack/Planet Puzzle League is a "match 3" type of game where the point is to match 3 or blocks either vertically or horizontally. Matching more than 3 blocks is a "combo" and causing other matches to result from one of your matches is called a "chain". Blocks are presented in a 6x12 grid as shown below:

### Controls
Panello, being a clone, functions in just the same way, just with controls geared toward a mobile platform. There is no cursor, you just place your finger on the block you want to manipulate. The controls are as follows:

|:Function                  :|:Gesture                                    :|
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------:|
|Swap with block to the left |Place finger on a block and swipe left       |
|Swap with block to the right|Place finger on a block and swipe right      |
|Force raise one row         |During a non-puzzle game, swipe down anywhere|
|Undo last move              |During a puzzle game, swipe down anywhere    |
|Pause game                  |During game, double tap anywhere             |
|Select an option            |Tap the option (revolutionary!)              |

### Screenshots
(Screenshots forthcoming)

I highly recommend playing Panel de Pon or any games in the Puzzle League series! Once this game is ready I hope to publish it as a free game on the app store, but there are more features I want to add first.
